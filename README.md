**For playing customs with a Quest user, they must manually install the matching beatmap you want to play with the prior to a session. So alert them to doing so before starting a play with these players.**

For PC players, doing customs is simple! Just go to the install instructions for the MultiplayerExtensions plugin and put it inside your Beat Saber Plugins folder. You can view these instructions by clicking [here](https://github.com/Zingabopp/MultiplayerExtensions#installation).
